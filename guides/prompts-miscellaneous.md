**# High-Stakes Prompt Engineering**

Think of the techniques below as experimental plays in your betting strategy playbook. They're fresh, potentially powerful, but require careful calibration before you wager heavily on them.  Adapt, test, and see if they can give you an edge!

**Topics:**

* **Active Prompt: The Adaptive Edge:** This is about teaching your LLM to learn the *best* ways to analyze a bet.  Instead of relying on fixed examples, you're helping it develop a dynamic approach, potentially increasing its accuracy over time.

* **Directional Stimulus Prompting: Subtle Signals, Big Payoffs:**  Think of this as insider tips whispered to your LLM.  Instead of rigid instructions, you offer subtle hints, allowing it to make surprisingly nuanced predictions on even complex bets.  

* **ReAct: Think, Bet, Adjust:**  What if your LLM could reason through its predictions, then act on them? Imagine it analyzing a game, spotting an unexpected opportunity, and adjusting its bet accordingly. This framework moves beyond simple prediction and into the realm of real-time betting strategy.

**The High Roller's Challenge**

Betting success is about more than just odds. Can you use these techniques to:

* **Spot Patterns Others Miss:**  Identify trends and opportunities your rivals overlook?
* **Manage Your Bankroll:**  Develop prompts that factor in risk tolerance and smart bankroll management?
* **Fact-Check on the Fly:**  Train your LLM to cross-reference predictions with real-world data for added confidence?

**Disclaimer:** Even the most advanced AI is no guarantee of a win. These techniques are tools, and their success depends on your skill in wielding them.  

**Let's Get Specific**

Do you want to explore adapting any of the existing examples to specific betting scenarios? Let's turn those abstract descriptions into actionable prompts!Absolutely!  Since the primary focus of this section is highlighting cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques, here's how we can rewrite it to emphasize the novelty and experimental nature of these approaches:

**# Prompt Engineering: At the Bleeding Edge**

This section is your laboratory for exploring the latest, untamed frontiers of prompt engineering.  These techniques are fresh from the research world, ready to be tested, refined, and pushed to their limits.  Consider them powerful tools, but with a touch of the unpredictable! 

**Note: This section is a work in progress. Consider yourself a pioneer!**

**Topics:**

* **Active Prompt**  Think of this as your LLM's personal trainer.  Instead of fixed examples, Active Prompting helps the model learn the *best* ways to solve problems. (Diao et al., (2023): [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12246.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12246.pdf))

* **Directional Stimulus Prompting**  Guide your LLM with subtle hints instead of rigid instructions.  A small, specialized language model crafts these hints, allowing even massive LLMs to be surprisingly agile. (Li et al., (2023): [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11520](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11520) )

* **ReAct**  What if your LLM could think, then act? ReAct allows for a chain of reasoning, followed by interactions with the outside world (like looking up facts or using tools).  Suddenly, your LLM isn't just answering questions, it's solving problems. (Yao et al., 2022: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629))

**The Challenge**

These techniques are powerful but still evolving. Can you adapt them to new tasks? Discover their strengths and weaknesses? Share your findings to help shape the future of prompt engineering!

**Let me know if you'd like help adapting any examples from the original text to this new, experimental framing!**Unfortunately, it's challenging to directly adapt the content on this GitHub page to a "casino version GPT" theme without fundamentally changing the purpose of the technical guide. Here's why:

* **Technical Focus:** This guide dives into prompt engineering, a complex area of AI language model development.  The concepts are inherently abstract and not easily translated into casino-themed counterparts.
* **Specificity:** Examples like "Chain-of-thought" and "Active-Prompt" are specific prompt design methods, unlikely to have direct casino-themed equivalents.

**However, here's how we can approach the task with some creative adjustments:**

**1. Analogy-Based Rewrite**

* **Prompt Engineering as Strategy:** Instead of technical details, focus on high-level strategy. Compare prompt engineering to crafting winning strategies in casino games â€“  careful observation, pattern recognition, and calculated risk.
* **Models as Players:** Describe LLMs as skilled players with varying strengths (like card counting vs. bluffing). Prompts become the instructions that guide their play for maximum winnings.
* **Examples as Games:** Adapt technical examples vaguely. "Chain-of-Thought" could become a complex card game where previous moves inform the next. "Active-Prompt" could be about shifting strategy based on the dealer's tells.

**2.  Casino-Themed Guide (Separate from GitHub)**

* **New Focus:** Create a guide specifically for developing a casino-focused GPT model.
* **Topics:**
    * Training data on casino game rules, odds, and terminology.
    * Prompts for generating realistic game scenarios or dialogue.
    * Techniques to avoid promoting irresponsible gambling behavior.

**The Dealer's Tell: Mastering Prompts for Your Casino AI**

In the high-stakes world of casino games, every word counts.  Prompt engineering is the art of teaching your AI to read the table, bluff with the best, and calculate odds like a pro shark.  With the right prompts, your language model won't just play the game, it'll change the house rules.

**Get Ready to Stack the Chips**

This guide will teach you:

* **The Lingo:**  Training your AI to understand the jargon of blackjack, roulette, and everything in between.
* **High Roller Dialogue:** Crafting prompts for realistic, engaging conversations with players that keep them at the tables.
* **Responsible Play:**  How to ensure your casino AI promotes safe and entertaining experiences.

**Important Note:** Remember, the house always has an edge.  Even the smartest AI can't guarantee a win, but with careful prompt engineering, you'll maximize your chances!

**Let me know if you'd like me to either rewrite portions of the GitHub page with analogies OR create a sample outline for a new casino GPT guide!**

## Active-Prompt

Chain-of-thought (CoT) methods rely on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars. The problem with this is that the exemplars might not be the most effective examples for the different tasks. To address this, [Diao et al., (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12246.pdf) recently proposed a new prompting approach called Active-Prompt to adapt LLMs to different task-specific example prompts (annotated with human-designed CoT reasoning).

Below is an illustration of the approach. The first step is to query the LLM with or without a few CoT examples. *k* possible answers are generated for a set of training questions. An uncertainty metric is calculated based on the *k* answers (disagreement used). The most uncertain questions are selected for annotation by humans. The new annotated exemplars are then used to infer each question.

## Directional Stimulus Prompting
[Li et al., (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11520) proposes a new prompting technique to better guide the LLM in generating the desired summary.

A tuneable policy LM is trained to generate the stimulus/hint. Seeing more use of RL to optimize LLMs.

The figure below shows how Directional Stimulus Prompting compares with standard prompting. The policy LM can be small and optimized to generate the hints that guide a black-box frozen LLM.

## ReAct

[Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) introduced a framework where LLMs are used to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner. Generating reasoning traces allow the model to induce, track, and update action plans, and even handle exceptions. The action step allows to interface with and gather information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments.

The ReAct framework can allow LLMs to interact with external tools to retrieve additional information that leads to more reliable and factual responses.

## Multimodal CoT Prompting

[Zhang et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00923) recently proposed a multimodal chain-of-thought prompting approach. Traditional CoT focuses on the language modality. In contrast, Multimodal CoT incorporates text and vision into a two-stage framework. The first step involves rationale generation based on multimodal information. This is followed by the second phase, answer inference, which leverages the informative generated rationales.

The multimodal CoT model (1B) outperforms GPT-3.5 on the ScienceQA benchmark.
